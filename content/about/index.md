Experimenting with using the following authoring process:

* edited with [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_573435&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid&utm_content=1&utm_campaign=Corp-FY16Q3March-Dev-PJVS&gclid=CjwKEAiA1vjCBRDd-9q3w4OF6WUSJACWv_sVc_7uc18N1lQODqB6YLhgsi43d_Xp5ce8FAHYvUxCaxoClHrw_wcB),
* edited with [gvim](http://askubuntu.com/questions/77503/how-to-install-gvim) under [xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) from [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)
* generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Hugo is Wordpress without the bells and whistles and bloat.  
* pushed to a public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/asears/analyticsdream)
